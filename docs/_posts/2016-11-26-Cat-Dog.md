title: The Dog / The Cat
---

In 2015 and 2017 I was Associate Composer and Sound Designer of a new work at Belvoir St Theatre called [The Dog / The Cat](http://belvoir.com.au/productions/dog-cat/) by Lally Katz and Brendan Cowell.

Starring Xavier Samuel, Benedict Hardie, and Andrea Demetriades, and directed by Ralph Myers, it originally showed at Belvoir's Downstairs theatre, before being [renewed for a season Upstairs](http://belvoir.com.au/productions/the-dog-the-cat/).

I worked as associate under composer [Stefan Gregory](http://www.stefangregory.com.au/) to produce music and sound for the show.
