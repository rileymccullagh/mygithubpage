title: Bowraville
---

In 2016 I composed the theme tune to Bowraville, the Walkley award winning podcast by the newspaper The Australian.

Bowraville is a podcast about the murders of three Aboriginal children in northern NSW. Hosted by crime reporter Dan Box and produced by Eric George, the podcast has been met with great public interest. According to [The Walkley Foundation](http://www.walkleys.com/walkleys-winners/dan-box-eric-george-and-stephen-fitzpatrick/), "[a]s a direct result of this series, fresh murder charges have been laid against the accused and NSW Police have publicly apologised for their bungled, racist investigation."

The podcast has won [two Walkley awards for Coverage of Indigenous Affairs and for Best Podcast](http://www.walkleys.com/photojournalist-andrew-quilty-wins-gold-at-61st-walkley-awards-for-excellence-in-journalism/), a [Kennedy award for Outstanding Radio Current Affairs Reporting and Audio Blog](http://kennedyawards.com.au/), and a [Publish award for Best Podcast](http://publishawards.com.au/2016winners/).

Marlowe Fitzpatrick played the piano in the recording.
