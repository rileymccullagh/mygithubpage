title: Cheap Shiraz
---

I've just finished composing for a short film for some fellow UTS students.

It's called [Cheap Shiraz](https://www.facebook.com/cheapshiraz/), and it chronicles the lives of a group of Hellenistic stoners running an illegal orgy business on NSW's central coast. 

Its currently preparing to do the film festival runs here in Sydney, but I'll post it here once it's on the internet.
