title: Egoism - Better
---

In 2015 I helped the band Egoism record their second single. We recorded this in my lounge room with no budget and a real DIY attitude.

Oliver Rush and Scout Eastment are cool cats. Here's their [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/egoness/) and their [BandCamp](https://egomusictime.bandcamp.com/)
